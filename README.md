This is a hidden disability sunflower brooch.

Hidden Disabilities Sunflower is a British scheme and company created to help people with hidden
disabilities navigate and find help in public places, by providing sunflower lanyards to provide for
people with hidden disabilities to signal their need for extra help in public.

This scheme has been adopted by many airports and train companies around the world. Staff members
are trained to spot the lanyards and help the wearer.

Now you can wear the sunflower as a brooch, to signal that you have a hidden disability. It can be
anything (e.g. ADHD, autism, anxiety, chronic pain, PTSD, dementia, chronic fatigue, etc) and you don't
need an official diagnosis.

You can find more info about that on <https://hdsunflower.com/>.

#### Needed parts

Apart from the print, you need a brooch finding (also known as
brooch pin). I've rendered it to fit 25 mm brooch pins, but as the design is parametric, you can
adapt it to fit any size. You can find those brooch pins in craft stores or at the big online
retailers.

#### Assembly

Just print the brooch and glue the brooch finding to the back using a glue gun.

#### The design process

I based this design on <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6243251>. However, the STL provided there
did have a number of issues and didn't render properly in OpenSCAD. I tried fixing it with Meshmixer
and using the Mirosoft® Windows™ STL repair algorithm, but it didn't work.

So I ended up opening the STL in Prusa Slicer, took a screenshot and used some GIMP and Inkscape
magic to slice off one of the ray flowers and convert it to a vector graphic.

This vector graphic is imported into OpenSCAD and aranged into a full flowerhead using a simple
algorithm.
