Print with a layer height of 0.2 mm and add filament or tool changes at the appropriate layers to
change the color. No MMU, multi tool or multi filament capabilities are required to print this.

If you want to print with a different layer height adjust the `layer_height` parameter accordingly
and re-render the design.
